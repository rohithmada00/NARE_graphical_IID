1. Check the effect of changing lambda fixing threshold
2. Effect of changing threshold fixing lambda
3. Effect of scaling Btrue
4. Effect of increasing diagonals from tri-diagonals
5. Oscillation in NARE error - what does this mean
6. Effect of adding too much or too low diagonal constant; when Btrue has a negative eigen value
